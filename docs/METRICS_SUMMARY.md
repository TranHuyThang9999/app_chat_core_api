# Metrics Monitoring Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to implement metrics monitoring in the application.

## 1. Package Installation

Added the `prometheus-net.AspNetCore` NuGet package to enable metrics collection and exposition.

## 2. Core Configuration

### Program.cs
- Added `using Prometheus;` statement
- Registered metrics server on port 5050
- Added middleware for HTTP metrics collection
- Registered custom metrics middleware

## 3. Custom Metrics Service

### AppMetricsService.cs
Created a service that provides custom application metrics:
- User login attempts counter (with success/failure labels)
- Messages sent counter
- File uploads counter (with file type labels)
- API calls counter (with controller/action labels)
- Request duration histogram (with endpoint labels)

### Service Registration
- Added `AddAppMetrics()` extension method in ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs
- Registered the service in Program.cs

## 4. Enhanced Metrics Middleware

### MetricsMiddleware.cs
Created middleware to automatically track metrics without requiring controller modifications:
- Request duration tracking for all endpoints
- API call counting by controller and action
- Automatic tracking of specific events:
  - File uploads (with content type)
  - Login attempts (success/failure)
  - Messages sent

## 5. Clean Controller Implementation

Reverted controllers to remove direct metrics service dependencies:
- AuthController: No direct metrics dependencies
- MessagesController: No direct metrics dependencies
- FileController: No direct metrics dependencies

All metrics are now collected automatically through middleware.

## 6. Documentation

### README-CI-CD.md
Updated to include metrics monitoring information.

### MetricsGuide.md
Created comprehensive guide for using and extending metrics with middleware-based approach.

## 7. Available Metrics

### Built-in HTTP Metrics
- `http_requests_received_total`
- `http_requests_in_progress`
- `http_request_duration_seconds`

### Custom Application Metrics
- `app_user_login_attempts_total{status="success|failure"}`
- `app_messages_sent_total`
- `app_file_uploads_total{file_type="content-type"}`
- `app_api_calls_total{controller="name", action="name"}`
- `app_request_duration_seconds{endpoint="route"}`

## 8. Accessing Metrics

Metrics are available at: `http://localhost:5050/metrics`

## 9. Integration with Monitoring Stack

### Prometheus Configuration
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'app-chat-api'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['your-app-host:5050']
```

### Example Queries
- Rate of login attempts: `rate(app_user_login_attempts_total[5m])`
- Total messages sent: `app_messages_sent_total`
- 95th percentile request duration: `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(app_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, endpoint))`

## 10. Extending Metrics

To add new metrics:
1. Modify AppMetricsService.cs to add new metric definitions
2. Add corresponding methods to IAppMetricsService interface
3. Update MetricsMiddleware.cs to track the new metrics where appropriate
4. No controller modifications needed
